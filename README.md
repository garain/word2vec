#Notice

The word2vec algorithms has been ported to the TeensorFlow architecture. See:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/tutorials/word2vec/index.html

Below is the deprecated word2vec implementation.

#Introduction

This tool provides an efficient implementation of the continuous bag-of-words and skip-gram architectures for computing vector representations of words. These representations can be subsequently used in many natural language processing applications and for further research.

#Quick start
* Run 'make' to compile word2vec tool
* Run the demo scripts: ./demo-word.sh and ./demo-phrases.sh
* For questions about the toolkit, see http://groups.google.com/group/word2vec-toolkit
